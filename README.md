What we're doing here: 

1. We change lives: Belonging. Fulfillment. Connection. Value.
2. We stand for: Communities. Altruism. Virtue. Citizenship.
3. We hate: Spam. Wasted community. Tragedy of commons. Mean people winning.

The anger: online communities suck by nature. Their inherent suckiness shows up in gradual loss of focus, spam, bullying, and a diminishing value over time/growth. The efforts of moderators, CMs, janitors, and rule-bots preserve communities against value-entropy. It takes work.

The people in my communities aren't terrible people. My social feeds shouldn't be bad. Getting added to a big group text or email conversation shouldn't be obnoxious. If we were all in a room together it'd be fine. So it's bullshit that the same group, online, suffers from the negative effects (focus, spam, etc) of these strange artifacts (the incentives, pressures, rules) forced upon it by the shape of the system.

The change: online communities should work according to the rules of regular communities of people in a room. The social value. The collaborative experience. The rules of the game. The expected value of belonging to a group. The social texture and norms of the group.

The problem of online communities sucking will continue to exist regardless of whether these changes are sufficient to solve it or not, because the ways we engage aren't designed. They're reskinned copies of copies of a few tools sysops built in the seventies: IRC. Email. Usenet. How limiting.

Vision: miniature digital utopias where me and my fellows give to each other. Help, entertainment, advice, comfort. A virtuous tribe for every context at every degree of privacy. An economic angel sitting on everyone's shoulder. Valuable contributions incentivized by negative contributions being automatically minimized. (Who decides what's what? The community.)

What are you making? Better communities.

Why are you making it? Because I've spent a shitton of time in online communities. They've legitimately been my primary recreation at points in my life. As a first-generation citizen of the internet I can see the road we're walking down, and it looks like being locked in a minor circle of hell, and not at all the technoutopia we were promised, all because we're too lazy to solve fundamental problems and limit ourselves to optimization problems on engagement and design and content. Because digital communities are tremendously valuable, and they've got a tremendous problem with value loss and nobody else even thinks there's a problem once they fire up a slack channel. I want the internet, or a corner of it, anyway, to be a reflection of our better selves.
