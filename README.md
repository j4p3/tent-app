What we're doing here: 

1. We change lives: Belonging. Fulfillment. Connection. Value.
2. We stand for: Communities. Altruism. Virtue. Citizenship.
3. We hate: Spam. Wasted community. Tragedy of commons. Mean people winning.

The anger: online communities suck by nature. Their inherent suckiness shows up in gradual loss of focus, spam, bullying, and a diminishing value over time/growth. The efforts of moderators, CMs, janitors, and rule-bots preserve communities against value-entropy. It takes work.

The people in my communities aren't terrible people. My social feeds shouldn't be bad. Getting added to a big group text or email conversation shouldn't be obnoxious. If we were all in a room together it'd be fine. So it's bullshit that the same group, online, suffers from the negative effects (focus, spam, etc) of these strange artifacts (the incentives, pressures, rules) forced upon it by the shape of the system.

The change: online communities should work according to the rules of regular communities of people in a room. The social value. The collaborative experience. The rules of the game. The expected value of belonging to a group. The social texture and norms of the group.

The problem of online communities sucking will continue to exist regardless of whether these changes are sufficient to solve it or not, because the ways we engage aren't designed. They're reskinned copies of copies of a few tools sysops built in the seventies: IRC. Email. Usenet. How limiting.

Vision: miniature digital utopias where me and my fellows give to each other. Help, entertainment, advice, comfort. A virtuous tribe for every context at every degree of privacy. An economic angel sitting on everyone's shoulder. Valuable contributions incentivized by negative contributions being automatically minimized. (Who decides what's what? The community.)

What are you making? Better communities.
